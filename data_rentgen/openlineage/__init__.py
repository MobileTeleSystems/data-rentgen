"""OpenLineage models & facets.

Currently, openlineage-python [does not support](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/issues/2629) deserialization from JSON.
So we have to write our own deserialization logic.

Also FastStream support only ``pydantic`` models whether openlineage-python provides ``attrs`` models.
