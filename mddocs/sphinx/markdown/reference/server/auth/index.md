# Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

To access the serviceâ€™s endpoints, a client must authenticate. The service provides several options for authentication.

Currently, the service does not implement a role-based model, and all users have the same level of permissions.

Authentication is implemented via middleware as follows: before each endpoint call, the get_user() function is invoked. This function attempts to retrieve the username from the provided token.

Data Rentgen supports different auth provider implementations. You can change implementation via settings:

Right now service has two scenarios for authentication:

- [Dummy(JWT Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) a lightweight option for testing and development.
- [Keycloak authentication](https://www.keycloak.org/) recommended option. Integrates with Keycloak for token-based authentication.

## Authentication Providers

* [Dummy Auth provider](dummy.md)
* [Keycloak Provider](keycloak.md)

## For developers

* [Custom Auth provider](custom.md)
