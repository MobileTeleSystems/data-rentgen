# CLI for cleaning old partitions { #cleanup-partitions-cli }

This script is designed to manage PostgreSQL table partitions by providing functionalities to list, detach, remove, or truncate old partitions.

```shell
usage: python3 -m data_rentgen.db.scripts.cleanup_partitions truncate --keep-after 2025-01-01
```

The `cleanup_partitions.py` script helps automate the cleanup of old table partitions based on a specified keep-after date. It supports different commands for dry runs, detaching partitions, removing data, and truncating partitions.
It's automatically inditifies partitioned tables and their granularity.

## Arguments

- `command`: (Optional) Specifies the operation mode.
  - Choices: `dry_run`, `detach`, `truncate`, `drop`
  - Default: `dry_run`
  - Description:
        - `dry_run`: Logs the names of partitions that would be affected by the cleanup without executing any SQL commands.
        - `detach`: Generates and executes `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION ...` commands for identified old partitions. This keeps partition data intact, but consumer & server will have no access to these partitions.
        - `truncate`: Generates and executes `TRUNCATE TABLE ...` commands, removing all rows from the identified old partition tables but keeping the table structure. **This option is preferred if you have streaming operations, g.e. Flink or Spark Streaming jobs**.
        - `drop`: First detaches partitions, then generates and executes `DROP TABLE ...` commands, permanently deleting the partition tables and their data.
- `--keep-after`: (Optional) The cut-off date for partitions. Partitions with data before this date will be considered for cleanup.
  - Type: Date (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`). The script uses isoparse for parsing, so various ISO formats are supported.
  - Default: The current date - 1 year.
  - Description: Only partitions whose date components are strictly before this specified date will be processed taking into account granularity of the table.

## Examples

1. Perform a Dry Run (default):

    ```shell
    python3 -m data_rentgen.db.scripts.cleanup_partitions dry_run --keep-after 2024-01-01
    ```

    This command will log which partitions would be affected if you were to clean up partitions older than January 1, 2024, without making any changes to your database.

2. Detach Partitions Older Than a Specific Date:

    ```shell
    python3 -m data_rentgen.db.scripts.cleanup_partitions detach_partitions --keep-after 2024-01-01
    ```

    This will detach all partitions created before January 1, 2024, from their parent tables. The detached tables will still exist with their data.

3. Remove Data and Drop Partitions Older Than a Specific Date:

    ```shell
    python3 -m data_rentgen.db.scripts.cleanup_partitions remove_data --keep-after 2024-01-01
    ```

    This will detach and then **drop all partitions** created before January 1, 2024, permanently deleting their data.

4. Truncate Data in Partitions Older Than a Specific Date:

    This option is preferred with streaming `Jobs`

    ```shell
    python3 -m data_rentgen.db.scripts.cleanup_partitions truncate --keep-after 2024-01-01
    ```

    This will delete all rows from partitions created before January 1, 2024, but will keep the empty partition tables.

Truncate or detach partitions, before provided date.
