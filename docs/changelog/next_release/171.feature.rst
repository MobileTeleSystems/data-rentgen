Include sum inputs & outputs to lineage responses.
For example, if user asked for lineage with ``granularity=OPERATION``, include inputs & outputs with detalization to ``RUN`` (sum of all included operations by ``run_id``) and ``JOB`` (sum of all included operations by ``job_id``).
This allows to show that specific operation is some specific percent of all operations within this run or job.
