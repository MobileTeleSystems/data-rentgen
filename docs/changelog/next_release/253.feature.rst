Improve storing lineage data for long running operations.

Previously if operation was running for a long time (more than a day, Flink streaming jobs can easily run for months or years),
and lineage was fetched for last day, there was no Flink job/run/operation in the graph.
This is because we created input/output/column lineage at operation start,
and ``RUNNING`` events of the same operation (checkpoints) were just updating the same row statistics.

Now we create new input/output/column lineage row for checkpoints events as well.
But only one row for each hour since operation was started, as increasing number of rows slows down lineage graph resolution.

For short-lived operations (most of batch operations take less than hour) behavior remains unchanged.
