* Make matching for addresses and locations more deterministic by converting them to lowercase.
  Items ``oracle://host:1521`` and ``ORACLE://HOST:1521`` are the same item ``oracle://host:1521``.

* Make matching for datasets, jobs, tags and user names case-insensitive by using unique indexes on ``lower(name)`` expression.
  Item ``database.schema.table`` and ``DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE`` are the same item.

  As dataset canonical name depends on database naming convention (UPPERCASE for Oracle, lowercase for Postgres),
  we can't convert them into one specific case (upper or lower). Instead we use first received value as canonical one.
