0.4.3 (2025-11-21)
==================

Features
---------

- Disable ``server.session.enabled`` by default. It is required only by KeycloakAuthProvider which is not used by default.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Escape unprintable ASCII symbols in SQL queries before storing them in Postgres. Previously saving queries containing ``\x00`` symbol lead to exceptions.
- Kafka topic with malformed messages doesn't have to use the same number partitions as input topics.
- Prevent OpenLineage from reporting events which claims to read 8 Exabytes of data, this is actually a Spark quirk.
